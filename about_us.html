<h3>Whit is a 31 year old nerd who's love of computers has been a driving force since the early 90's. <br>Throughout what could graciously be described as a "rough" childhood, they've survived long enough to get here. <br>They now make small websites as a hobby in the hopes that it will one day get them a job.</h3>
